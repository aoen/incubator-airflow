class BaseDepContext(object):
    """
    A base class for contexts that specifies which dependencies should be evaluated in
    the context for a task instance to satisfy the requirements of the context. Also
    stores state related to the context that can be used by dependendency classes.

    For example there could be a SomeRunContext that subclasses this class which has
    dependencies for:
    - Making sure there are slots available on the infrastructure to run the task instance
    - A task-instance's task-specific dependencies are met (e.g. the previous task
      instance completed successfully)
    - ...

    :param flag_upstream_failed: This is a hack to generate the upstream_failed state
        creation while checking to see whether the task instance is runnable. It was the
        shortest path to add the feature. This is bad since this class should be pure (no
        side effects).
    :type flag_upstream_failed: boolean
    :param ignore_all_deps: Whether or not the context should ignore all ignoreable
        dependencies. Overrides the other ignore_* parameters
    :type ignore_all_deps: boolean
    :param ignore_depends_on_past: Whether or not the depends_on_past parameter of DAGs
        should be ignored (e.g. for Backfills)
